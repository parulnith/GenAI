This repo collects my experiments across generative AI, creative coding, and interactive simulations. Everything here is lightweight, browser-friendly, and easy to test or remix.

## ðŸ”§ What's Inside

- **3D Shapes**: A basic 3D renderer using HTML and CSS transforms.
- **Earth Explorer**: An interactive globe visualizer that pulls Earth data.
- **Greeting Card Generator**: A Python + Notebook tool that uses AI to write and design custom greeting cards.
- **Grounding Gemini**: A minimal chatbot prototype built using Gemini.
- **Wrecking Ball**: A physics-based game using Matter.js and MediaPipe for gesture control.
- **Simulations Folder**: Includes fun physics and visual experiments like ragdolls, sand, fireworks, kaleidoscopes, water molecules, and slingshots.
- **Prompts.md**: Notes, ideas, and concept prompts for future simulations or app ideas.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Most `.html` files run in your browserâ€”no setup needed.  
For Python notebooks and scripts, see the individual folder `README.md` for instructions.

## ðŸ¤– About

This is a scratchpad. Each project is a small test of an ideaâ€”some silly, some serious. If you find something useful, feel free to fork it or build on top of it.
