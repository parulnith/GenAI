## Cloth
Create a cloth physics simulation using Matter.js in JavaScript. The 800x600 canvas contains a grid-based cloth made of small interconnected physics nodes that react to gravity, wind, and collisions. The cloth can be dragged, stretched, or pinned at certain points. Implement tearable fabric mechanics, adjustable wind forces, and realistic spring physics to simulate flowing movement

## Sand Simulation
Create a falling sand physics simulation using Matter.js and HTML5 Canvas in JavaScript. The 800x600 canvas acts as a sandbox, where clicking releases thousands of small sand particles that fall under gravity, colliding and forming realistic piles  and slopes. Implement different materials (sand, water, stone), adjustable wind forces,  and eraser tools for modifying the environment

## Hydrogen bonds in water molecules
Create an interactive simulation that shows water molecules forming and breaking hydrogen bonds. The visualization should depict molecular motion, with oxygen in white and hydrogen in red. A temperature slider should control movement speed and bond stability. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file for real-time interaction

## Ragdoll
Create a ragdoll physics simulation using Matter.js and HTML5 Canvas in JavaScript. The simulation features a stick-figure-like humanoid composed of rigid bodies connected by joints, standing on a flat surface. When a force is applied, the ragdoll falls, tumbles, and reacts realistically to gravity and obstacles. Implement mouse interactions to push the ragdoll, a reset button, and a slow-motion mode for detailed physics observation

## Dominos
Make a domino chain game in one HTML file using Matter.js with a big black screen and gray floor. Let me click to add white dominoes, drag them around, or remove them with a right-click. They should fall like real dominoes. Add a slider to change how far apart they are, buttons to place a row, start the chain, and reset, plus a counter for fallen ones. Keep it fun and simple!

## Galton Board

## Fireworks
Create a fireworks rocket explosion simulation using p5.js and GSAP in JavaScript. The 800x600 canvas allows kids to click to launch rockets that explode into colorful sparks. Implement smooth animations, randomized explosion effects, and color-changing particles
